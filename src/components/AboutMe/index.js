            <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p>Hi, I'm Dustin Gottlieb, a 35 year old resident of Minneapolis, Minnesota. I'm a data specialist in the gift card industry. I've been with my current company for 15 years, where I'm known for being able to fix or figure out most every problem
            thrown my way. I'm looking to enter the Web Development and Coding career fields and apply my abilities in a space with more room for growth. If you enjoy nature or the night sky, take a look at my instagram!
